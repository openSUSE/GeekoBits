# GeekoBits
A 3d printable model of brick-made openSUSE mascot geeko done in [LeoCAD](https://www.leocad.org/) from a
[LDraw gallery](https://www.ldraw.org/). 

Currently based on a custom model SUSE Linux s.r.o. purchased from Mr. Menzl / kostkyvplzni.
The original color on the picture is “Lime” . I did use “Bright Green” in LeoCAD
